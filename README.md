# Project Description

Our Application is a Single Page Application that utilizes the `display: none` and `display: block` which allows a User to navigate through different pages within our SPA.

Our application aims at easing the connectivity between doctors and patients through the ability to search for doctors and book appointments via the application.

Each doctor registered in the application will be assigned a card. The card will display their information from the backend. This information will include: doctor name, specialization, image and appointments booked.

Users will be able to see upcoming appointments and book additional appointments through the application.

Users will also be able to share and view health blogs within the application.
